<h3>Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>

<p>Machine Learning is of 4 types : Supervised , Unsupervised , Semi-Supervised and Reinforcement Learning</p>
<h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
<p>In supervised learning, the machine uses labelled data(pre-determined input and output) to learn annd predict. It then matches the predictions and actual output to determine the model's success. Example - House Price Prediction. Data containing 'House prices' which is dependent upon No. of Rooms, Floor Area, Terrace,etc (independent variables) is provided. The model then learns on this data and predicts its own prices.</p>
<p>Supervised machine learning include Regression and Classification</p>
